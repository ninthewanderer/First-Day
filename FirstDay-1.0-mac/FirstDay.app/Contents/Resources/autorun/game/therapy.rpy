screen therapy:
    # the goal is to have two vertical boxes on either side of the screen.
    # only one will show at a time as characters alternate speech.

    # the text box on the right, lao's text box, will occasionally be replaced with
    # a list of choices. 

    # each choice box will have a different color attached to it.


    # test code from when i initially messed around with screens.
    frame:
        xpadding 10
        ypadding 300
        xalign 0.075
        yalign 0.5
        # text "You've created a new Ren'Py game."
